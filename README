-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a introductory description of the purposes and capabilities of
OpenOffice::OODoc, please read the OpenOffice::OODoc::Intro manual
page. This page in contained in the OODoc/Intro.pod file of the CPAN
distribution. It can be read on line using the following link:

http://search.cpan.org/dist/OpenOffice-OODoc/OODoc/Intro.pod

There is an alternative intro for french-reading users. It's available in
ODF (http://jean.marie.gouarne.online.fr/doc/oodoc_guide.odt) or PDF
format (http://jean.marie.gouarne.online.fr/doc/oodoc_guide.pdf).

See INSTALL for system requirements and installation instructions for
the CPAN original distribution.

The present version supports both the OpenOffice.org 1.0 document format
and the OASIS OpenDocument Format (ODF) 1.0. It works with ODF 1.1 and
1.2 as well, knowing that its present features are not directly impacted
by the changes between the successive versions of the ODF specification.
In addition, advanced users can rely on OpenOffice::OODoc to process any
kind of flat or zipped XML files, in order to combine ODF documents with
non-ODF XML data through a single application programming interface.
