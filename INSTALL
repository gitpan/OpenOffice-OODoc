OpenOffice::OODoc 1.103 installation (Mar 2004)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

	Perl		>= 5.8.0
	Archive::Zip	>= 1.05
	XML::XPath	>= 1.13
	
TODO

	Uncompress the distribution archive, enter the OpenOffice-OODoc-1.102
	directory and (as system administrator), type the following commands:

		perl Makefile.PL
		make install test

	You will be warned about unsatisfied dependencies, if any.

	Unless you omit the 'test' option, the installation test script
	attempts to create an OpenOffice.org (SXW) file. You should check this
	file using OpenOffice.org Writer; it contains a PNG logo and a short
	description of the installation. The content of this document is
	generated with the OpenOffice::OODoc API, so if you get it you can
	assume the installation is complete.
