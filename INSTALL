OpenOffice::OODoc installation (Aug 2004)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

	Perl		>= 5.8.0
	Archive::Zip	>= 1.05  (*)
	XML::XPath	>= 1.13
	Time::Local	>= 1.07
	File::Temp	>= 0.12

	* The Archive::Zip version is not a requirement, but only a
	recommendation. No version check is done for this extension in the
	present distribution. As a consequence of a numbering anomaly in some
	deployed Archive::Zip distributions, this version control caused
	unnecessary installation failures.
	
TODO

	Uncompress the distribution archive, enter the OpenOffice-OODoc-x.xxx
	directory and (as system administrator), type the following commands:

		perl Makefile.PL [options]
		make test
		make install

	You will be warned about unsatisfied dependencies, if any.

	You will be prompted for the following parameters:
	- the local character set (default = iso-8859-1);
	- an optional color map file (default = none), if the user needs to
	use symbolic names instead of RGB values for color attributes in the
	documents (this file can be the generally available "rgb.txt" file
	of the X-Window system, or the "rgb.txt" provided with the Color::Rgb
	Perl distribution, or any specific, user-defined file with the same
	structure;
	- the working directory for temporary files (by default, the working
	directory is the current directory of each application).

	The interactivity can be avoided by the --noprompt option.
	The parameters can be provided at the command line with (respectively)
	the --encoding <encoding>, --colormap <file>  and --workdir <path>
	options. Example:
	
	perl Makefile.PL --noprompt --workdir "C:\Temp" --encoding iso-8859-15

	These options define installation-level default values only; each of
	these values can be overridden by the applications (thanks, for
	example, to the ooLocalEncoding(), ooWorkingDirectory() and
	ooLoadColorMap() functions. The installation-level options are stored
	in a XML file (OODoc/config.xml) below the installation directory.

	If the installation is successful, the test procedure generates an
	OpenOffice.org document, writes some content in it, and checks the
	result. You can later open this document with OpenOffice.org Writer
	or a compatible software; the file is named 'ootest.sxw' and resides
	in the working directory of the installation.
