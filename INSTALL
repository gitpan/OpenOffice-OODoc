OpenOffice::OODoc installation (2008-10-10)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

	Perl		>= 5.8.0
	Archive::Zip	>= 1.14
	XML::Twig	>= 3.22
	Time::Local	>= 1.07
	File::Temp	>= 0.12

INSTALLATION FROM THE CPAN DISTRIBUTION

	Uncompress the distribution archive, enter the OpenOffice-OODoc-x.xxx
	directory and (as system administrator), type the following commands:

		perl Makefile.PL [options]
		make test
		make install

	For MSWin32, "make" can be replaced by "nmake". If the Microsoft NMAKE
	utility is not present in your environment, you can get it at
	http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe
	
	If Archive::Zip and XML::Twig are already installed, this CPAN
	installation works without a C compiler, because OpenOffice::OODoc is
	pure Perl. Otherwise, if these required modules are not installed and
	if you don't have a C development environment, you should use another
	distribution (such as the PPM one for ActivePerl, if available) instead,
	knowing that the CPAN Archive::Zip and XML::Twig distributions can
	indirectly bring a lot of C source code.

	You will be prompted for the following parameters:
	- the local character set (default = iso-8859-1);
	- an optional color map file (default = none), if the user needs to
	use symbolic names instead of RGB values for color attributes in the
	documents (this file can be the generally available "rgb.txt" file
	of the X-Window system, or any specific, user-defined file with the same
	structure);
	- the working directory for temporary files (by default, the working
	directory is ".", i.e. the current directory of each application);
	- the preferred file format, to be used when you create a new
	document from scratch (answer "1" for OpenOffice.org, "2" for OASIS
	OpenDocument Format, default is "2").

	The interactivity can be avoided by the --noprompt option.
	The parameters can be provided at the command line with (respectively)
	the --encoding <encoding>, --colormap <file>, --workdir <path> and
	--format <number> options. Example:
	
	perl Makefile.PL --noprompt --workdir "C:\Temp" --encoding "cp1252"

	The full customization step can be avoided with the --noconfig option.
	If this option is used, all the default values are installed.
	
	These options define installation-level default values only; each of
	these values can be overridden by the applications (thanks, for
	example, to the odfLocalEncoding(), odfWorkingDirectory() and
	odfLoadColorMap() functions). The installation-level options are stored
	in a XML file (OODoc/config.xml) below the installation directory.
	This file can be manually edited at any time after the installation
	in order to change any parameter.
	
	A variable $OpenOffice::OODoc::INSTALLATION_DATE is available for the
	applications; it contains the installation date in ISO-8601 format.
	If the customization has been skipped (due to the --noconfig option),
	this variable contains the packaging date of the distribution.
	Caution, this value is significant if the installation has been done
	from the original CPAN distribution only.

	The date of the original CPAN package is provided by the variable
	$OpenOffice::OODoc::BUILD_DATE.

	If the installation is successful, the test procedure generates a
	document, writes some content in it, and checks the result. This
	document is named 'odftest.odt' or 'ootest.sxw' (according to your
	default file format) and resides in the working directory of the
	installation. You can later check this document with a compatible
	text processor or viewer.

	A Perl executable script, oodoc_version, is provided in the package.
	After a successful installation using the CPAN distribution,
	this script displays the version number, the package build date,
	and the installation path. A more sophisticated script, oodoc_test,
	is provided as an executable example; this script generates a document
	which may be checked using an ODF-compatible text processor.
