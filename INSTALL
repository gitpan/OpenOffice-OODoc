OpenOffice::OODoc installation (Aug 2005)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

	Perl		>= 5.8.0
	Archive::Zip	>= 1.06
	XML::Twig	>= 3.15
	Time::Local	>= 1.07
	File::Temp	>= 0.12

INSTALLATION

	Uncompress the distribution archive, enter the OpenOffice-OODoc-x.xxx
	directory and (as system administrator), type the following commands:

		perl Makefile.PL [options]
		make test
		make install

	For MSWin32, "make" can be replaced by "nmake". If the Microsoft NMAKE
	utility is not present in your environment, you can get it at
	http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe
	
	If Archive::Zip and XML::Twig are already installed, this CPAN
	installation works without a C compiler, because OpenOffice::OODoc is
	pure Perl. Otherwise, if these required modules are not installed and
	if you don't have a C development environment, you should use another
	distribution (such as the PPM one for ActivePerl, if available) instead,
	knowing that the CPAN Archive::Zip and XML::Twig distributions can
	indirectly bring a lot of C source code.

	You will be prompted for the following parameters:
	- the local character set (default = iso-8859-1);
	- an optional color map file (default = none), if the user needs to
	use symbolic names instead of RGB values for color attributes in the
	documents (this file can be the generally available "rgb.txt" file
	of the X-Window system, or the "rgb.txt" provided with the Color::Rgb
	Perl distribution, or any specific, user-defined file with the same
	structure);
	- the working directory for temporary files (by default, the working
	directory is ".", i.e. the current directory of each application);
	- the preferred file format, to be used when you create a new
	document from scratch (answer "1" for OpenOffice.org, "2" for OASIS
	Open Document, default is "1").

	The interactivity can be avoided by the --noprompt option.
	The parameters can be provided at the command line with (respectively)
	the --encoding <encoding>, --colormap <file>, --workdir <path> and
	--format <number> options. Example:
	
	perl Makefile.PL --noprompt --workdir "C:\Temp" --encoding "cp1252"

	These options define installation-level default values only; each of
	these values can be overridden by the applications (thanks, for
	example, to the ooLocalEncoding(), ooWorkingDirectory() and
	ooLoadColorMap() functions). The installation-level options are stored
	in a XML file (OODoc/config.xml) below the installation directory.
	This file can be manually edited at any time after the installation
	in order to change any parameter.

	If the installation is successful, the test procedure generates an
	OpenOffice.org document, writes some content in it, and checks the
	result. You can later open this document with OpenOffice.org Writer
	or a compatible software; the file is named 'ootest.sxw' or
	'ootest.odt' (according to your default file format) and resides
	in the working directory of the installation.
