OpenOffice::OODoc 1.105 installation (May 2004)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

	Perl		>= 5.8.0
	Archive::Zip	>= 1.05
	XML::XPath	>= 1.13
	
TODO

	Uncompress the distribution archive, enter the OpenOffice-OODoc-1.104
	directory and (as system administrator), type the following commands:

		perl Makefile.PL
		make install test

	You will be warned about unsatisfied dependencies, if any.

	If the installation is successful, the test procedure generates an
	OpenOffice.org document, writes some content in it, and checks the
	result. You can later open this document with OpenOffice.org Writer
	or a compatible software (the file is named 'ootest.sxw' and resides
	in the working directory of the installation).
