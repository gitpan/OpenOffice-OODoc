OpenOffice::OODoc examples and local character sets
---------------------------------------------------

The examples provided with the distribution are not "localised",
so, if they run unchanged, the OpenOffice::OODoc encoding mechanism
operate as if the user's character set was the default one, that is
iso-8859-1.

If you experience some local character misrepresentations, you should
"localise" these example, by the indication of your local character
set. To do so, you just have to insert a localCharacterSet statement
immediately after the "use OpenOffice::OODoc;" line.

Examples:

# for Western Europe with Euro currency symbol:
ooLocalEncoding 'iso-8859-15';

# for Central Europe:
ooLocalEncoding 'iso-8859-2';

The supported values are the same as with the Encode Perl module.

Starting with OpenOffice::OODoc 1.2, it's possible to select a
user-defined default local character set at the installation time, or
later by manually editing the "OODoc/config.xml" file.

In real projects, even if the default encoding is convenient, it's
strongly recommended to systematically use this statement with a
variable argument, and to manage the local character set as a
runtime parameter.
