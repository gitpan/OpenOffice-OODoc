OpenOffice::OODoc examples and local character sets
---------------------------------------------------

The examples provided with the distribution are not "localised",
so, if they run unchanged, the OpenOffice::OODoc encoding mechanism
operate as if the user's character set was the default one, that is
iso-8859-1.

If you experience some local character misrepresentations, you should
"localise" these example, by the indication of your local character
set. To do so, you just have to insert a localCharacterSet statement
immediately after the "use OpenOffice::OODoc;" line.

Examples:

# for Western Europe with Euro currency symbol:
localEncoding 'iso-8859-15';

# for Central Europe:
localEncoding 'iso-8859-2';

The supported values are the same as with the Encode Perl module.

In real projects, even if the default encoding is convenient, it's
strongly recommended to systematically use this statement with a
variable argument, and to manage the local character set as a
runtime parameter.
